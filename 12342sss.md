YogaAgeProof AI is an AI-driven skincare companion app that empowers users to age-proof their face naturally by combining personalized routines, intelligent guidance, and holistic self-care tools.

**Core Features & Flows:**
- **AI Face Scanner:** Users analyze their skin with an AI-powered face scan, generating a personal skin profile with detected type and concerns.
- **Routine Builder:** The AI analyzes the uploaded user photo, then automatically generates several personalized face yoga and skincare routines. The user selects their preferred routine. In the next step, users add products suggested for the selected routine, categorized by step (e.g., cleanser, serum, moisturizer). Users must pick products from these suggestions, and can search for more info or purchase online using the integrated search tool.
- **Routine Player:** Step-by-step, blends face yoga sessions and product applications, with session imagery, usage advice, timers, and helpful tips.
- **Routine Evaluator:** Allows users to analyze the effectiveness of completed routines, see improvement timelines, and receive notifications about gaps or recommendations.
- **Skin Diary:** Users log daily mood, triggers, and skin state, reviewing entries in a calendar-based diary.
- **AI Photo Gallery & Comparison:** Users capture and upload daily photos into a gallery. The AI highlights subtle skin changes over time; users can review before/after images and progress in a simple, intuitive viewer.
- **Products Tool:** Browse and preview only those products suggested for the active routine, organized by step/category. Each product card features an “AI” button for insights and an online search button for further info. (No compare, expiration management, wishlist, or shelves.)
- **Notifications:** Centralized notifications center for reminders, tips, and alerts related to routines, progress, and updates.
- **Personalization & Support:** Multi-language support, personal recommendations, notification management, privacy/data options, account management, and support/FAQ screens.

**Onboarding & Tutorial:**
- Welcome and onboarding consist of a three-screen slider tutorial introducing key app benefits, process (face scan → routine generation → daily progress), and main features.

**Design System:**
- **Palette:** Deep Green (#24543A), Muted Gold (#C8A55A), Off-White (#F4F0E8), Charcoal Text (#1E1E1E), Warm Grey (#6F6A61)
